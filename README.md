# Triton

> [!NOTE]
> *Triton, a figure from Greek mythology and son of Poseidon, had the ability to calm and stirr the waves by blowing his conch shell.*

Triton is a Telegram bot to handle staked Olas services. Triton can help you to:
- Monitor your wallet balances (agent, safe and operator wallets) and receive an alert when they are too low.
- Check your staking status (mech requests and rewards)
- Check empty slots on staking contracts
- Claim your rewards (manual and automatic mode)
- Withdraw your OLAS

Point triton to all your trader_quickstart folder locations (they have to contain the `.operate` folder) and it will handle them.

    - `WITHDRAWAL_ADDRESS`: optional. An address to send your rewards to.
    - `AGENT_BALANCE_THRESHOLD`: if the agent balance goes lower than this, you will receive an alert.
    - `SAFE_BALANCE_THRESHOLD`: if the safe balance goes lower than this, you will receive an alert.
    - `MANUAL_CLAIM`: enable manual claiming command. Defaults to false.
    - `AUTOCLAIM`: enable automatic claiming command (claims once per month). Defaults to false.
    - `AUTOCLAIM_DAY`: day of the month for the autoclaim task to run.
    - `AUTOCLAIM_HOUR_UTC`: UTC hour for the autoclaim task to run.
    - `LOCAL_TIMEZONE`: Local timezone for the time shown in the alerts.
